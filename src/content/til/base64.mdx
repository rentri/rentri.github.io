Base64 encoding allows us to encode any bytes to "safe" bytes, bytes which are known to be safe to send
without getting corrupted. 

Example of "unsafe" bytes would be control characters.

To send text with Base64 encoding we first encode the text to say UTF-8, after that we group the binary into chunks of 3 bytes,
we further divide the chunks into four 6-bit groups. Now each 6-bit group can represent values between `0` and `63`, 
these values are then mapped to the corresponding Base64 character.

What if the chunks are not of 3 bytes?

For 1 extra byte we have space left for 2 bytes, we pad the econding with `==`

For 2 extra byte we have space left for 1 byte, we pad the encoding with `=`

The reciever will have to reverse the process to recover the original text.
